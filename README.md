# RemoteGamingConsole
This Remote Gaming Server allows users to play games anywhere without having to bring their console with them.This is accomplished by hosting a website with login authentication to control the amount of users that will be using the server. The webpage has an admin page to control users and turn on/off the server using threading. Once registered, users can login and download either the graphical user interface or the mobile application. Once downloaded, user's can login and connect a controller, then the user can stream video from their console. The button presses are passed back to the server using sockets in a separate thread from the streaming socket. The mobile app will work the same as the GUI (Graphical User Interface), the only differences are that the controllers can connect over Bluetooth and you can cast the video stream to a TV. This Project will be packaged in an RPM(Red-Hat Package Manager) so it can be deployed on any server.
